Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh
I just saw a red flag
Gonna pretend I didn't see that
'Cause is it really,
really that bad?
I need you really,
really that bad
So, can we keep
this story rolling?
Forget that shit
my mother always told me
'Cause nothing's
really perfect like that
I need you really,
really that bad
I need you really,
really that bad
The one I run to
Take my makeup off and
say goodnight to
The one I pretty talk and
ugly cry to
The world can roll their eyes,
but there's no use
I just want it to bе you
When it's 3 a.m.​
I'm losing myself
and my mind again
The onе who gives me love
that is bulletproof
The world can roll their eyes,
but there's no use
I just want it to be you
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh
I just want it to be you
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh
I just want it to be you
Hold me
Kiss me on my face
Talk shit about the world
with me all day
And even when I putting you
through hell
Say I'm not like anyone else
Slowly worlds roll off my tongue
You're everything I need
and it's so dumb
And even when you put me
through hell
You're not like anyone else
The one I run to
Take my makeup off and
say goodnight to
The one I pretty talk and
ugly cry to
The world can roll their eyes,
but there's no use
I just want it to bе you
When it's 3 a.m.​
And I'm losing myself and
my mind again
The onе who gives me love that
is bulletproof
The world can roll their eyes,
but there's no use
I just want it to be you
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh
I just want it to be you
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh
I just want it to be you
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh
I just want it to be you
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh
I just want it to be you
